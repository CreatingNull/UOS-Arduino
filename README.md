The arduino implementation of the UOS remote control protocol.
This software allows run-time control over embedded systems operation. 
See the [official project documentation](https://wiki.nulltek.xyz/projects/uos/).

Status: Under active development, pre-release versions are available for testing.

## Getting Started

This operating system is optimised for ATMega328P hardware. 
It should work across multiple Arduino architectures, however pin mappings may change, and there is no guarantee of stability.

It is tested on:
*   Arduino Nano
*   Arduino Uno 

For the best results.

### Installing from Source

This method is aimed at users familiar with the arduino IDE and / or users who need to make modifications to the project.

1.  Download the latest source from [tags](https://github.com//CreatingNull/UOS-Arduino/tags).
2.  Included in the source is a zipped library for serial communications, this needs to be added through the arduino IDE. 
3.  Select the hardware and programming method through the IDE and then compile / upload the code to the target device.

### Built using

*   [Arduino 1.8.13](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino) - Primary Compiler and IDE.
*   [Processing](https://processing.org/) - Operating System Loop / Handler Language.
*   [C++](https://isocpp.org/) - For the NPC serial communications libraries.

This project uses: 

*   clang-format to format it's C++ and C code using google styling.
    ``` sudo apt-get install clang-format ```
